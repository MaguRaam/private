1) Stiffened equation of state (how long its been  there)
2) Why there is an error difference between Kirchhoff and Weno
3) What is the classical paper in cloud of collapsing cavitation bubbles (Nice Mathematical problem, application, how wakes are generated)
4) What are the challenges in solving this problem.
5) What is the novelty.
5) How are we going to arrange the bubbles (no of bubbles distribution).
6) Is the linear wave equation valid outside the control surface. (what should be p/p_0 value)
